# Lean4 and the Curry-Howard Isomorphism: The Deep Connection Between Logic and Programming Through Type Theory.

In this talk, we will explore the inner workings of interactive proof assistants
such as Lean4 and discover a profound connection between mathematical logic and
computer programs known as the Curry-Howard Isomorphism.
At the heart of this correspondence lies type theory, the formal study of type
systems---the same kind you know from strongly-type programming languages like C++.
Lean4 is a functional programming language that is also strongly typed.
But it's special in sense that it's equipped with a type system so powerful,
that it is capable of expressing any mathematical statement (as a type) and
formally verifying their proofs (by constructing the type).
In this way it's possible to construct the entirety of mathematics within Lean4.

People are actually doing this by creating a library called Mathlib!
There's even a project that tries to rewrite every theorem and proof of the
undergraduate math curriculum of Imperial College London in Lean.
Famous mathematicians like Terrance Tao are also using Lean to formalize their
complex conjectures.

The most impressive real-life application of Lean4 to me is the use of it in
AI-driven mathematics.
For instance Google DeepMind's AlphaProof, built with Lean4, recently solved an
International Math Olympiad problem at the level of a Silver Medalist!
This breakthrough shows how proof assistants have the potential to transform
mathematics, paving the way for automated mathematical superintelligience.
